In what light does the text explicitly portray migrants, immigrants, asylum seekers, or ethnic minorities?
Negative only if the article itself promotes harmful views, stereotypes, or narratives that may worsen public opinion about the group.
(e.g. reporting that someone committed a crime as a member of that group, blaming them for societal problems, etc.)
NOTE: Reporting on hate crimes, racism, or discrimination against a group does not imply negative sentiment â€” such stories may even increase empathy or awareness.
Do not classify as 'Negative' just because the article describes tragic events or discrimination.
If the group is shown as the **victim** and the tone is sympathetic or neutral, the sentiment should be **Neutral or Positive**
Use unrelated to indicate that the text does not explicitly portray any of these groups in a light that is not positive, negative or neutral.
