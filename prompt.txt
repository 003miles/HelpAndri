Frames migration as uncontrolled, illegal, or a threat to UK stability

Connects migrants to terrorism or foreign extremism in ways that may stoke fear, xenophobia, or far-right agitation

Reports global events in ways that could raise suspicion or hostility toward UK-based migrant communities

Neutral — if the article:

Reports facts or policies without judgment

Describes tragedy or hate crimes where migrants are victims, and tone is factual or empathetic

Positive — if:

The article highlights migrants' contributions (e.g. social, economic, cultural)

Migrants are humanised, protected, or treated with compassion

Unrelated — if:

The groups are not directly portrayed, or only mentioned in passing
